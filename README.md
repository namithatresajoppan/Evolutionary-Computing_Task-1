Evoman is a video game playing framework inspired on Megaman.

In the first task it was required that we develop two evolutionary algorithms (EA)- either 2 different algorithms or by varying the parameters of the same algorithm- to train a specialist agent by training it against 3 different enemies. The DEAP framework of python was used to develop the evolutionary algorithm and 2 different EAs were implemented by changing the mutation algorithm. Uniform and Gaussian mutation algorithms were implemented. Extensive parameter tuning also had to be done before finally choosing the algorithms. A detailed report is also attached in this repository with results.
